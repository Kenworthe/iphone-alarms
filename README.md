# iphone-alarms

The default iOS alarm tones suck. These are better.


## Required Software & Hardware
- Music app (formerly iTunes)
- Lightning-to-USB-C cable
- iPhone & MacBook


## Tested on: 
- iOS 16.1 (20B82)  
- macOS Monterey 12.6 (21G115)


## How to Import

1. `git clone` this repo onto your MacBook.
1. Plug your iPhone into your MacBook, using a Lighting-to-USB-C cable.
1. Open Finder on your MacBook, and navigate to the plugged in iPhone under "Locations".
1. Select "Trust" on both your iPhone and MacBook, when prompted. 
1. On the General tab, check the box for "Manually manage music, etc."
1. Select all of the `.m4r` files in `assets/ringtones`, and drag and drop them anywhere on Finder's "sync iPhone" window. A small loading bar should appear and complete almost immediately.
1. On your iPhone, go to Clock > Alarms > Sound, and you should now see the new alarm tones at the top of the list.
